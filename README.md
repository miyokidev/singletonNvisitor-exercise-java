# singletonNvisitor-exercice-java
Project on design patterns in this project I'll use the Creational Pattern: "Singleton" and the Behavioral Patterns: "Visitor". This project is for school.

I'm using this as a documentation and I published it on a classroom course for my class that's why comments are in French it was to help other people and myself at same time.
